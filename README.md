# 🛠⚙️🛠 Automation for Dev's 🛠⚙️🛠

A place for developers to use and contribute ways to help them in their daily dev life. 

As per my [post](https://www.danielvanc.com/notes/automating-my-dev-life-starts-from-now), to start this off, I will be documenting when and where I can automate work and provide shortcuts to make daily dev life just that little bit easier so that I/we can focus on the things that really matter.

## How this will work
1. New issue for each problem that could be solved with automation/shortcut
2. Each issue will have the context and a solution to go with it.


## How can you help?

1. Provide solutions to the issue's already submitted
2. Provide alternate solutions to the solutions already provided
3. Provide new issues that arise in the work you do on a daily basis
